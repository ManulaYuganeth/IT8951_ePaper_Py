## Examples

Here are a few examples to help you get started:

### Displaying Text

You can display text on the e-paper using the following method:

```python
from it8951 import IT8951

display = IT8951()
display.clear()
display.display_text("Hello, E-Paper!")
```

### Displaying an Image

To display an image, use the `display_image` method:

```python
display.display_image("path/to/image.png")
```

### Full Example

Hereâ€™s a full example that combines text and images:

```python
from it8951 import IT8951

def main():
    display = IT8951()
    display.clear()
    display.display_text("Welcome to IT8951 E-Paper")
    display.display_image("path/to/image.png")
    display.update()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
